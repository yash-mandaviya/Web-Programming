		<p>The Taj Mahal 'Crown of the Palace', originally the Rauza-i-munawwara is an ivory-white marble 
		mausoleum on the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra.</p>

		<p>It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house
		the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.</p>

		<p>The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest 
		house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall</p>
